# Agriculture Project

This project is aimed at helping farmers determine the most suitable crops to cultivate based on sensor data collected from their fields. It provides insights into which crops are best suited for the current environmental conditions and highlights any factors that may make certain crops unsuitable.

## Features

- Collect sensor data manually or through actual sensors.
- Analyze sensor data to identify best-suited crops.
- Display unsuitable reasons for each crop based on sensor data.
- Record previous sensor data for future reference.
